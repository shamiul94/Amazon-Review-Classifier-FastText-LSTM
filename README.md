# Amazon-Review-Classifier-FastText-LSTM
It's just a simple classifier based on [this Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/snap/amazon-fine-food-reviews).
This code was written on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com). You can upload it to Kaggle and run it there or download the dataset and run it on local machine. 
FastText was used as the word to vector embedding layer and LSTM was our deep learning model.
